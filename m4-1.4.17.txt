       Short Description: GNU M4 v1.4.17 for OS/2
        Long Description: GNU M4 v1.4.17 for OS/2.
GNU M4 is an implementation of the traditional Unix macro processor. It is
mostly SVR4 compatible although it has some extensions (for example, handling
more than 9 positional parameters to macros). GNU M4 also has built-in
functions for including files, running shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc.

v1.4.17 : AC_INIT fails due to m_esyscmd failure. Fixed

v1.4.16 : Support a response file( using -Zargs-resp compiler flag )
